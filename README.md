## Restaurant Bookings, exploration and going out needs.

<p>
Finding out about new and good street food places, upcoming concerts, parties, and gigs happening in your city becomes a task. Tracking small opportunities of sightseeing, maybe a beautiful night sky constellation or a new momos stall is an issue all the localities face daily. Try to eliminate this issue by creating a program which provides info about latest concerts, shows, food places and stalls, any offers at places around their city, any new sightings like a rainbow or pretty skies etc and make it user friendly so that people can also post about their finds. It should also include the process to find best restaurants according to a personâ€™s personal preference especially because a lot of confusion occurs in choice of food places due to the bombardment of Instagram reels. Participants will be required to find the best restaurants to eat by using various parameters like - type of cuisine, locality, availability of seats. Not only this, but the solution should also be such that it can learn from your previous choices and model new responses based on the feedback provided. It should automatically suggest restaurants to try out when the weekend approaches and other unique features.
